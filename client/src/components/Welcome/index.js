      <p>There is the idea of measuring our energy, physical or mental, as spoons. You have a certain number 
        of spoons, and once they are used up, it's really hard to function. This metaphor has especially been adopted 
      by those in the chronic illness and mental health communities. When you really need to talk to someone, 
    chances are, you are already pretty low on spoons. You shouldn't have to use your last spoons trying to get help. </p>
