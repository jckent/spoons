            <h2>Some Facts</h2>
            <p>Finding mental health care is hard. Even when you have health insurance. In one study, researchers
              attempting to schedule an appointment were only able to do so 26% of the time after making 720 calls. 
              As anyone who has tried before knows, going down a list from your insurance provider can be frustrating, at best.
              The information provided can be completely out of date. The therapist may no longer be accepting new patients, or
              your insurance, or may just never call you back. The number listed could go to a McDonald's. It's no wonder that 
              by the fourth call, you feel even worse.</p>
